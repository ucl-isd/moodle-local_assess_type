Feature: LTI activities can be marked as summative
  In order to identify which LTI activities count towards the final mark
  As a teacher
  I need to be able to set an LTI activity as summative.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And the following "mod_lti > course tools" exist:
      | name          | baseurl                         | course |
      | Course tool 1 | https://example.com/tool        | C1     |
      | Course tool 2 | https://another.example.com/tool | C1     |
      | Course tool 3 | https://another.example.com/tool | C1     |

  Scenario: Admin can select LTI types that can be marked as summative
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Local > Assessment type settings" in site administration
    Then "LTI Types" "field" should exist
    And I open the autocomplete suggestions list
    And I should see "another.example.com LTI-1 (2)" in the ".form-autocomplete-suggestions" "css_element"
    And I should see "example.com LTI-1 (1)" in the ".form-autocomplete-suggestions" "css_element"

  Scenario: User cannot mark an LTI activity as summative if it has not been configured to allow this
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    When I add a "Course tool 1" to section "1" using the activity chooser
    Then "Formative or summative?" "field" should not exist
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I add a "Course tool 2" to section "1" using the activity chooser
    And "Formative or summative?" "field" should not exist
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I add a "Course tool 3" to section "1" using the activity chooser
    And "Formative or summative?" "field" should not exist

    And I press "Save changes"
